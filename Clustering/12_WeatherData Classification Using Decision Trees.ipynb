These measurements were then processed to generate values to describe daily weather. Since this dataset was created to classify low-humidity days vs. non-low-humidity days (that is, days with normal or high humidity), the variables included are weather measurements in the morning, with one measurement, namely relatively humidity, in the afternoon.
