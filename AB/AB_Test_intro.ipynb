        "A/B testing is an experimental approach in data science where two versions of a variable (A and B) are compared. The goal is to identify which version performs better in terms of a predefined metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why A/B Testing?\n",
        "- Measure the impact of changes on key business metrics.\n",
        "- Make data-driven decisions to improve customer experience.\n",
        "- Widely used in web design, marketing, and product development.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Control Group**: Receives the original version (A).\n",
        "- **Treatment Group**: Receives the modified version (B).\n",
        "- **Metric**: The measurable outcome (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate) to assess success.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Limitations of A/B Testing\n",
        "- **Not Suitable for Small Audiences**: A/B tests require sufficient data for reliable results.\n",
        "- **Short-Term vs Long-Term Effects**: Results may vary over time.\n",
        "- **One Change at a Time**: Testing multiple changes can be complex (consider Multivariate Testing if needed).\n",
        "\n",
        "# How A/B Testing Works\n",
        "The process involves:\n",
        "1. **Define Objective**: Set a clear hypothesis.\n",
        "2. **Create Variants**: Design the control and treatment versions.\n",
        "3. **Split the Audience**: Randomly assign users to either group.\n",
        "4. **Measure & Compare**: Analyze the results to check if the difference is statistically significant."
